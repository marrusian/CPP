- Terms that are used to change the behavior of a stream are
called "manipulators".

- An istream that reads from a string is called an istringstream
and an ostream that stores characters written to it in a 
string is called an ostringstream.

- The stringstreams are generally used when we want to
separate actual I/O from processing.
